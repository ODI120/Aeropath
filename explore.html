                <h3>History Of Aviation</h3>
                <p>Aviation is one of the most remarkable achievements in human history. 
                    From ancient dreams of flight to today’s advanced aircraft and space exploration, 
                    aviation has continuously pushed the boundaries of science, engineering, and imagination.
                </p>

                <h3>Early Milestones</h3>
                <p>The idea of flying has fascinated humans for thousands of years. One of the earliest flight-related myths is 
                    the story of Icarus and Daedalus from ancient Greek mythology. According to legend, 
                    Daedalus built wings made of feathers and wax for himself and his son Icarus. 
                    But Icarus flew too close to the sun, melting the wax and falling to his death. 
                    While fictional, such tales reflect humanity’s deep desire to conquer the skies.
                </p>
                <p>The first scientific studies of flight began much later. Pioneers like Leonardo da Vinci 
                    in the 15th century sketched early designs of flying machines based on the movement of birds. 
                    However, it wasn't until the 18th and 19th centuries that real progress was made, 
                    with the invention of hot air balloons by the Montgolfier brothers in 1783.
                </p>
                <p>The true breakthrough came in 1903, when Orville and Wilbur Wright, two American inventors 
                    and bicycle mechanics, successfully flew the Wright Flyer the world’s first powered, 
                    controlled, and sustained aircraft. This historic flight lasted only 12 seconds but 
                    proved that human flight was possible.

                <h3>Development Through the World Wars</h3>
                <p>The First World War (1914–1918) marked a turning point in aviation. Airplanes were 
                    used for reconnaissance, bombing missions, and air combat. Aircraft designs 
                    evolved rapidly, with improved engines, weapons, and maneuverability. 
                    Pilots became new kinds of heroes, and air forces were formed as essential 
                   parts of national defense.
                </p>
                <p>The Second World War (1939–1945) saw even more dramatic developments. 
                    Aircraft became faster, more powerful, and more specialized. Bombers like 
                    the B-17 Flying Fortress and fighters like the Spitfire and Messerschmitt Bf 109 
                    dominated the skies. The war also introduced radar, pressurized cabins, and jet 
                    engines with Germany's Me 262 becoming the world’s first operational jet-powered 
                    fighter aircraft.
                    By the end of the war, aviation had advanced by decades in just a few years.

                <h3>The Jet Age and Commercial Aviation</h3>
                <p>After WWII, many wartime technologies were adapted for civilian use. The Jet Age 
                    officially began in 1949 with the launch of the de Havilland Comet, 
                    the first commercial jet airliner. Though it faced early technical issues, it paved 
                    the way for more advanced aircraft.
                </p>
                <p>In 1958, the Boeing 707 became the first successful long-range commercial jet. 
                    It revolutionized air travel, offering faster, smoother, and more comfortable 
                    journeys across continents. Airlines expanded rapidly, and air travel became more 
                    affordable and accessible to the general public. In 1958, the Boeing 707 became the

                    Airlines expanded rapidly, and air travel became more affordable and accessible to 
                    the general public. The 1960s and 70s brought iconic aircraft like the Boeing 747, 
                    known as the "Queen of the Skies." It could carry hundreds of passengers and 
                    transformed the global travel industry.

                <h3>Recent Developments</h3>
                <p>Modern aviation is marked by innovation, automation, and sustainability. 
                    Today's aircraft are built with advanced materials like carbon composites, are powered 
                    by efficient turbofan engines, and are controlled by digital flight systems.
                </p>
                <p>Key trends in recent aviation include:
                    <li><ul>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs): Commonly known as drones, these are used in military, commercial, and recreational settings.</ul></li>
                    <li><ul>Automation: Modern cockpits use advanced autopilot systems, reducing pilot workload and increasing safety.</ul></li>
                    <li><ul>Green Aviation: There's a growing push for environmentally friendly solutions, including electric aircraft, biofuel-powered engines, and carbon-neutral airport operations.</ul></li>
                    <li><ul>Supersonic Travel: After the retirement of the Concorde in 2003, new efforts are underway to reintroduce supersonic commercial flight.</ul></li>
                    <li><ul>Space Tourism: Companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Virgin Galactic are working to make space travel available to private citizens</ul></li>
                </p>
                <p>From ancient myths to modern marvels, the history of aviation is a story of ambition, 
                    perseverance, and innovation. Each era brought breakthroughs that changed the way we live, 
                    connect, and explore. As technology advances, aviation continues to shape the future 
                    reaching beyond the sky into space.
