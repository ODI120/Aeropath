                <h2>Post-Pandemic Recovery and Resilience</h2>
                <p>The COVID-19 pandemic brought the aviation industry to a standstill in 2020, causing historic losses.
                    However, it also led to transformation and resilience-building:</p>
                <h3>Health and Safety Protocols</h3>
                <p>Enhanced cleaning procedures, HEPA filters, and social distancing measures are now standard.</p>
                <p>Contactless check-ins, digital health passports, and mobile boarding have improved passenger confidence.
                </p>
                <h3>Digital Transformation</h3>
                <p>Airlines and airports accelerated their adoption of digital tools for bookings, tracking, and
                    communications.</p>
                <p>Mobile apps now handle everything from booking to baggage claim, offering a seamless travel experience.
                </p>
                <h3>Business Model Shifts</h3>
                <p>Many airlines diversified operations including focusing more on cargo transport due to reduced passenger
                    demand.</p>
                <p>Some fleets were downsized, and route networks were redesigned to be more flexible and efficient.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="section">
                <h2>Environmental and Sustainability Initiatives</h2>
                <p>As climate concerns grow, the aviation industry is under pressure to reduce its environmental impact.
                    Several initiatives are underway to make flying more sustainable:</p>
                <h3>Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs)</h3>
                <p>SAFs are produced from renewable sources like plants, algae, or recycled waste.</p>
                <p>They can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel.</p>
                <p>Airlines like KLM, Delta, and British Airways are already testing or using SAFs in regular flights.</p>
                <h3>Electric and Hybrid Aircraft</h3>
                <p>Research is ongoing into battery-powered and hybrid-electric aircraft for short-haul flights.</p>
                <p>These could significantly reduce emissions and noise pollution, especially in regional aviation.</p>
                <h3>Carbon Offset Programs</h3>
                <p>Passengers can now pay to offset the emissions from their flights by supporting environmental projects.
                </p>
                <p>Airlines also invest in reforestation and carbon capture initiatives.</p>
                <h3>Greener Airports</h3>
                <p>Many airports are adopting solar power, green buildings, and electric ground vehicles to lower their
                    carbon footprint.</p>
                <p>Some, like Heathrow and Changi, aim to become carbon-neutral in the next decade.</p>

        <p class="conclusion">The aviation industry is undergoing a major transformation. As it recovers from the
            effects of the pandemic, it is embracing smarter technologies, greener solutions, and more resilient
            operations. These trends are not just shaping the future of flight, but also redefining the way we think
            about mobility, safety, and sustainability in a connected world.</p>
