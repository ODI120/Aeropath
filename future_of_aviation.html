                    <h2>Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and Electrification</h2>
                    <p>One of the biggest challenges facing aviation is its environmental impact. Future solutions are focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions through cleaner energy sources.</p>
                    <div class="subsection">
                        <h3>Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)</h3>
                        <p>SAF is made from renewable sources like plants, waste oils, agricultural residues, and even CO₂ captured from the air.</p>
                        <p>It can be used in today’s aircraft engines with little or no modification.</p>
                        <p>SAF can reduce carbon emissions by up to 80% over its lifecycle.</p>
                        <p>Governments and airlines are increasing investment and setting goals to make SAF widely used by 2030 and beyond.</p>

                        <h3>Electric and Hybrid-Electric Aircraft</h3>
                        <p>Several companies are developing fully electric or hybrid-electric aircraft for short-distance travel (less than 500 km).</p>
                        <p>These planes will be quiet, low-emission, and cost-efficient for regional flights.</p>
                        <p>Examples: Eviation’s Alice, Heart Aerospace ES-30, and Rolls-Royce hybrid propulsion projects.</p>

                    <h2>Urban Air Mobility (UAM) and eVTOL Aircraft</h2>
                    <p>Urban air mobility is a bold vision of city travel taking to the skies powered by electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft.</p>
                    <div class="subsection">
                        <h3>Key Features</h3>
                        <p>Compact aircraft that take off and land like helicopters but fly like drones or small planes.</p>
                        <p>Designed for short, point-to-point trips ideal for avoiding urban traffic.</p>
                        <p>Uses electric power, making them cleaner and quieter than helicopters.</p>
                        <p>Applications include air taxis, emergency response, and commuter services.</p>

                        <p><strong>In-Flight Safety</strong>: Despite being one of the safest modes of transport, aviation must constantly manage risks like technical failures, pilot error, and weather-related incidents.</p>
                        <p>Airlines and regulators invest heavily in training, modern aircraft technology, and safety procedures.</p>
                        <p><strong>Airport and Passenger Security</strong>: Airports are frequent targets for security threats, including terrorism, smuggling, and unauthorized access.</p>
                        <p>Screening processes use tools like X-ray and body scanners, biometric identification, and AI-powered surveillance.</p>
                        <p><strong>Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) / Drones</strong>: Increasing use of drones presents risks to commercial aircraft, especially near airports.</p>

                    <div class="subsection">
                        <h3>Environmental Impact and Emissions</h3>
                        <p><strong>Greenhouse Gas Emissions</strong>: Aviation contributes around 2–3% of global CO₂ emissions, expected to grow as air travel increases.</p>
                        <p>Aircraft engines also emit nitrogen oxides (NOₓ) and contrails, affecting the climate beyond CO₂ impact.</p>
                        <p><strong>Noise Pollution</strong>: Aircraft noise affects communities near airports, leading to health issues and public complaints.</p>
                        <p><strong>Resistance to Change</strong>: Transitioning to SAFs, electric aircraft, and greener infrastructure requires major investment and faces high costs and technological hurdles.</p>
