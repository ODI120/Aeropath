                <h2>Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and Electrification</h2>
                <p>One of the biggest challenges facing aviation is its environmental impact. Future solutions are focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions through cleaner energy sources.</p>
                <div class="subsection">
                    <h3>Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)</h3>
                    <p>SAF is made from renewable sources like plants, waste oils, agricultural residues, and even CO₂ captured from the air.</p>
                    <p>It can be used in today’s aircraft engines with little or no modification.</p>
                    <p>SAF can reduce carbon emissions by up to 80% over its lifecycle.</p>
                    <p>Governments and airlines are increasing investment and setting goals to make SAF widely used by 2030 and beyond.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="subsection">
                    <h3>Electric and Hybrid-Electric Aircraft</h3>
                    <p>Several companies are developing fully electric or hybrid-electric aircraft for short-distance travel (less than 500 km).</p>
                    <p>These planes will be quiet, low-emission, and cost-efficient for regional flights.</p>
                    <p>Examples: Eviation’s Alice, Heart Aerospace ES-30, and Rolls-Royce hybrid propulsion projects.</p>

                <h2>Supersonic and Hypersonic Travel</h2>
                <p>After the retirement of the Concorde in 2003, supersonic commercial flight vanished — but it may soon return, faster and greener.</p>
                <div class="subsection">
                    <h3>Supersonic Travel (Mach 1–2)</h3>
                    <p>Boom Supersonic's Overture is a new aircraft in development aiming to cut flight times in half (e.g., New York to London in ~3.5 hours).</p>
                    <p>These aircraft aim to be net-zero carbon, using SAF and advanced aerodynamics.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="subsection">
                    <h3>Hypersonic Travel (Mach 5 and above)</h3>
                    <p>Hypersonic aircraft could travel five times the speed of sound, enabling intercontinental flights in under 2 hours.</p>
                    <p>Still in early development, mainly in defense and experimental programs.</p>
                    <p>Major players: NASA, DARPA, SpaceX, and Hermeus.</p>
                    <p>If successful, these technologies will make global travel ultra-fast — possibly within a few decades.</p>
