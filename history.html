                    <h2>Early Dreams of Flight</h2>
                    <p>The idea of flying has fascinated humans for thousands of years. One of the earliest 
                        flight-related myths is the story of Icarus and Daedalus from ancient Greek mythology. 
                        According to legend, Daedalus built wings made of feathers and wax for himself and his 
                        son Icarus. But Icarus flew too close to the sun, melting the wax and falling to his death. 
                        While fictional, such tales reflect humanity’s deep desire to conquer the skies.
                    </p>
                    <img src="image/Icarus.webp" alt="">
                    <p>
                        In the 9th century, Abbas Ibn Firnas, an Andaludian inventor, attempted a glider-like flight, While
                        in 15th century Italy, Leonardy da Vinci setched designs for ornithopters and parachutes. Though, these designs
                        were not vry successful, they laid the groundwork for future aviation pioneers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first successful human flight came not with wings but with hot air balloons. In 1973, the Montgolfier brothers
                        launched a balloon carrying passengers in France. Soon after, hydrogen balloons allowed for longer flights. 
                        By the late 19th and early 20th centuries, dirigibles (airships) like the Zeppelin dominated long-distance
                        travel. However, disasters like the 1937 Hindenburg explosion mared the decline of airships in favour of airplanes.

                    <img src="image/balloon-cappadocia.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>The true breakthrough came in 1903, when Orville and Wilbur Wright, two American inventors 
                        and bicycle mechanics, achieved the first controlled, sustained powered flight in itty Haw, North Caroliner.
                        The Wright Fyer covered 120 feet in 12 seconds, revolutionizing transportation. Meanwhile, other pioneers like
                        Alberto Santos-Dumont (1906 Paris Flight) and Glenn Curtiss contributed to early aircraft design, setting the
                        stage for aviation's rapid advancement.

                    <h2>Development Through the Wars</h2>
                    <p>The First World War (1914–1918) marked a turning point in aviation. Airplanes were used for 
                        reconnaissance, bombing missions, and air combat. Aircraft designs evolved rapidly, with improved 
                        engines, weapons, and maneuverability, aerial dogfights, machine guns synchronized with propellers, and
                        improved aerodynamics emerged. By war's end, aviation had evolved from a novelty to a crucial military asset.
                    </p>
                    <img src="image/Vintage Aircraft 2.png" alt="">
                    <p>
                        The interwar period saw aviation become a symbol of progress and adventure. Charles Lindbergh's 1927 solo 
                        transatlantic flight in the Spirit of St. Louis captivated the world. Amelia Earhart broke gender barriers, While
                        Howard hughes set speed records. Commercial airlines like Pan Am and Imperial Airways began offering passenger 
                        services, though air travel remained a luxury.
                    </p>

                    <p>The Second World War (1939–1945) saw even more dramatic developments. Aircraft became faster, 
                        more powerful, and more specialized. Bombers like the B-17 Flying Fortress and fighters like the 
                        Spitfire and Messerschmitt Bf 109 dominated the skies. The war also introduced radar, 
                        pressurized cabins, and jet engines with Germany's Me 262 becoming the world’s first operational 
                        jet-powered fighter aircraft.

                    <p>By the end of the war, aviation had advanced by decades in just a few years. Post-waar, captured German
                        jet research propelled the U.S and the USSR into the Jet Age.

                        Aviation and aerospace became intertwined during the Cold War. The Bell X-1 (1947) broke the sound barrier, 
                        and NASA's X-15 (1959-1968) reached the edge of space. The Apollo program (1969 Moon landing) relied on aviation 
                        principles, proiding that flight technology could transcend Earth's atmosphere.
                        The X-1 designs borrowed heavily from high-altitude aviation research, including presurized cabins and
                        ultra-thin wings. The X-1 validated theories on shockwave dynamics, enabling future supersonic aircraft (like the 
                        F-104 Starfighter) and spacecraft re-entry profiles.

            <h2>History Of Aviation</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Aviation is one of the most remarkable achievements in human history. From ancient dreams 
                of flight to today’s advanced aircraft and space exploration, aviation has continuously pushed the 
                boundaries of science, engineering, and imagination.
            </p>
            <h4>Early Milestones</h4>

            <p>The first scientific studies of flight began much later. Pioneers like Leonardo da Vinci 
                in the 15th century sketched early designs of flying machines based on the movement of birds. 
                However, it wasn't until the 18th and 19th centuries that real progress was made, with the 
                invention of hot air balloons by the Montgolfier brothers in 1783.
                The true breakthrough came in 1903, when Orville and Wilbur Wright, two American inventors
