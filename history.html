            <h2>History Of Aviation</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Aviation is one of the most remarkable achievements in human history. From ancient dreams 
                of flight to today’s advanced aircraft and space exploration, aviation has continuously pushed the 
                boundaries of science, engineering, and imagination.
            </p>
            <h4>Early Milestones</h4>
            <p>
                The idea of flying has fascinated humans for thousands of years. One of the earliest 
                flight-related myths is the story of Icarus and Daedalus from ancient Greek mythology. 
                According to legend, Daedalus built wings made of feathers and wax for himself and his 
                son Icarus. But Icarus flew too close to the sun, melting the wax and falling to his death. 
                While fictional, such tales reflect humanity’s deep desire to conquer the skies.
            </p>
            <img src="image/Vintage Aircraft 5.png" alt="">
            <p>The first scientific studies of flight began much later. Pioneers like Leonardo da Vinci 
                in the 15th century sketched early designs of flying machines based on the movement of birds. 
                However, it wasn't until the 18th and 19th centuries that real progress was made, with the 
                invention of hot air balloons by the Montgolfier brothers in 1783.
                The true breakthrough came in 1903, when Orville and Wilbur Wright, two American inventors 
                and bicycle mechanics, successfully flew the Wright Flyer the world’s first powered, controlled, 
                and sustained aircraft. This historic flight lasted only 12 seconds but proved that human flight 
                was possible.

            <h2>Development through the wars</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>The First World War (1914–1918) marked a turning point in aviation. Airplanes were used for 
                reconnaissance, bombing missions, and air combat. Aircraft designs evolved rapidly, with 
                improved engines, weapons, and maneuverability. Pilots became new kinds of heroes, and air 
                forces were formed as essential parts of national defense.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Second World War (1939–1945) saw even more dramatic developments. Aircraft became 
                faster, more powerful, and more specialized. Bombers like the B-17 Flying Fortress and 
                fighters like the Spitfire and Messerschmitt Bf 109 dominated the skies. The war also introduced 
                radar, pressurized cabins, and jet engines with Germany's Me 262 becoming the world’s first operational 
                jet-powered fighter aircraft.
            </p>
            <p>By the end of the war, aviation had advanced by decades in just a few years.</p>

            <h2>The Jet Age and Commercial Aviation</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                After WWII, many wartime technologies were adapted for civilian use. The Jet Age officially 
                began in 1949 with the launch of the de Havilland Comet, the first commercial jet airliner. 
                Though it faced early technical issues, it paved the way for more advanced aircraft.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1958, the Boeing 707 became the first successful long-range commercial jet. It revolutionized 
                air travel, offering faster, smoother, and more comfortable journeys across continents. Airlines 
                expanded rapidly, and air travel became more affordable and accessible to the general public.
            </p>
            <p>
                The 1960s and 70s brought iconic aircraft like the Boeing 747, known as the "Queen of the 
                Skies." It could carry hundreds of passengers and transformed the global travel industry.
